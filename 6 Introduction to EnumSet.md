# Lesson 6: Introduction to EnumSet

## Overview

In this lesson, we will explore the EnumSet class, its methods, and practical use-cases.

## Introduction

EnumSet is a specialized Set implementation for use with enum types. All of the elements in an enum set must come from a single enum type that is specified, explicitly or implicitly, when the set is created. EnumSet is not synchronized. If multiple threads access an enum set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it should be synchronized externally.

## Chapters

1. **Understanding EnumSet**
   - Basics of EnumSet
   - How EnumSet works
   - Real-world examples of EnumSet usage

2. **Methods of EnumSet**
   - `noneOf(Class<E> elementType)`: Creates an empty enum set with the specified element type.
   - `allOf(Class<E> elementType)`: Creates an enum set containing all of the elements in the specified element type.
   - `copyOf(EnumSet<E> s)`: Creates an enum set with the same element type as the specified enum set, initially containing the same elements (if any).
   - `copyOf(Collection<E> c)`: Creates an enum set initialized from the specified collection.
   - `complementOf(EnumSet<E> s)`: Creates an enum set with the same element type as the specified enum set, initially containing all the elements of this type that are not contained in the specified set.

3. **Practical examples of EnumSet**
   - Implementing an EnumSet in Java
   - Using EnumSet methods

## Conclusion

EnumSet is a powerful class in Java, allowing for the creation of a specialized set for use with enum types. Understanding its methods and their usage is essential for effective programming in Java.

## Chapters

### 1. Understanding EnumSet

EnumSet is a specialized Set implementation for use with enum types. All of the elements in an enum set must come from a single enum type that is specified, explicitly or implicitly, when the set is created. EnumSet is not synchronized. If multiple threads access an enum set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it should be synchronized externally.

#### How EnumSet works

EnumSet is implemented as a bit vector. This representation is extremely compact and efficient. The space and time performance of this class should be good enough to allow its use as a high-quality, typesafe alternative to traditional int-based "bit flags."

#### Real-world examples of EnumSet usage

Real-world situations where EnumSet comes in handy include:

- **Flags**: EnumSet can be used to create a set of flags (as you would do with bit fields). For example, you can create an EnumSet of options, where each option is a flag that can be either on or off.

- **Singleton Sets**: EnumSet provides a typesafe way to create singleton sets (sets with only one element). This can be useful in many programming scenarios where a set is expected but you only have one element to add.

### 2. Methods of EnumSet

The EnumSet class provides a number of methods for manipulating a set, such as:

- `noneOf(Class<E> elementType)`: This static factory method creates an empty enum set with the specified element type.

- `allOf(Class<E> elementType)`: This static factory method creates an enum set containing all of the elements in the specified element type.

- `copyOf(EnumSet<E> s)`: This static factory method creates an enum set with the same element type as the specified enum set, initially containing the same elements (if any).

- `copyOf(Collection<E> c)`: This static factory method creates an enum set initialized from the specified collection.

- `complementOf(EnumSet<E> s)`: This static factory method creates an enum set with the same element type as the specified enum set, initially containing all the elements of this type that are not contained in the specified set.

### 3. Practical examples of EnumSet

#### Implementing an EnumSet in Java

Here's an example of how to implement an EnumSet in Java:

```java
enum Day {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EnumSet<Day> days = EnumSet.of(Day.MONDAY, Day.TUESDAY);
        
        for (Day d : days) {
            System.out.println(d);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Using EnumSet methods

You can also use EnumSet methods to manipulate the set. Here's an example:

```java
enum Day {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EnumSet<Day> days = EnumSet.of(Day.MONDAY, Day.TUESDAY);
        
        // Add elements
        days.add(Day.WEDNESDAY);
        
        // Remove element
        days.remove(Day.MONDAY);
        
        // Check if an element exists
        boolean exists = days.contains(Day.TUESDAY);
        
        // Get the size of the set
        int size = days.size();
    }
}
```
