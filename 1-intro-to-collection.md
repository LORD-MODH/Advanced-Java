# Lesson 1: Introduction to Java Collection Framework

## Overview

In this lesson, we will introduce the Java Collection Framework, understand the Collection Interface, and explore the basic operations of the Collection Interface.

## Introduction

The Java Collection Framework provides a set of interfaces and classes to implement data structures. These data structures are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data.

The Collection Interface is at the root of the Java Collection Framework hierarchy. It provides the standard methods that all collections will have, such as `add()`, `remove()`, `contains()`, `size()`, `clear()`, and `isEmpty()`.
