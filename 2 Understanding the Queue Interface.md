# Lesson 2: Understanding the Queue Interface

## Overview

In this lesson, we will delve into the Queue Interface, its methods, and practical examples of its use.

## Introduction

The Queue interface is part of the Java Collections Framework and extends the Collection interface. It is used to hold elements prior to processing and provides various operations such as inserting, removing, and inspecting elements.

   - Understanding the Queue Interface
   - Hierarchy of Queue Interface
   - Real-world examples of Queue usage

2. **Methods of Queue Interface**
   - `add(E e)`: Inserts the specified element into the queue if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions.
   - `offer(E e)`: Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions.
   - `remove()`: Retrieves and removes the head of this queue.
   - `poll()`: Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue is empty.
   - `element()`: Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue.
   - `peek()`: Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue is empty.

The Queue interface is a crucial part of the Java Collections Framework, providing a way to handle elements in a sequence. Understanding its methods and their usage is essential for effective programming in Java.

## Chapters

### 1. Basics of Queue Interface

The Queue interface is part of the Java Collections Framework and extends the Collection interface. It is used to hold elements prior to processing. Besides basic Collection operations, queues provide additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations.

Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner. Among the exceptions are priority queues, which order elements according to a supplied comparator or the elements' natural ordering.

#### Hierarchy of Queue Interface

The hierarchy of the Queue Interface is as follows:

- **Queue Interface**: It is the root interface in the queue hierarchy.

- **PriorityQueue, Deque, BlockingQueue, TransferQueue Interfaces**: These are subinterfaces of Queue Interface and provide more specific methods for manipulating queues.

#### Real-world examples of Queue usage

Real-world situations where queues come in handy include:

- **Printer Queue**: In a printer queue, print jobs are added to the end of the queue as they arrive and are removed from the front of the queue as each job is printed.

- **Process Scheduling**: Operating systems use queues to manage processes. Processes are added to the end of the queue as they arrive and are removed from the front of the queue as resources become available.

### 2. Methods of Queue Interface

The Queue Interface provides a number of methods for manipulating queues, such as:

- `add(E e)`: This method inserts the specified element into the queue if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning true upon success and throwing an IllegalStateException if no space is currently available.

- `offer(E e)`: This method inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions. When using a capacity-restricted queue, this method is generally preferable to add(E), which can fail to insert an element only by throwing an exception.

- `remove()`: This method retrieves and removes the head of this queue. This method differs from poll only in that it throws an exception if this queue is empty.

- `poll()`: This method retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue is empty.

- `element()`: This method retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue. This method differs from peek only in that it throws an exception if this queue is empty.

- `peek()`: This method retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue is empty.

### 3. Practical examples of Queue Interface

#### Implementing a Queue using LinkedList

LinkedList class in Java implements the Queue interface, providing the functionality of a queue. Here's an example:

```java
Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

// Add elements
queue.add(1);
queue.add(2);
queue.add(3);

// Remove element
int removedElement = queue.remove();

// Check if an element exists
boolean exists = queue.contains(2);

// Get the size of the queue
int size = queue.size();
```

#### Using PriorityQueue to implement a Queue

PriorityQueue class in Java implements the Queue interface. It holds the elements or objects which are to be processed by their priorities. PriorityQueue doesn't allow null values to be stored in the queue.

```java
Queue<Integer> queue = new PriorityQueue<>();

// Add elements
queue.add(1);
queue.add(2);
queue.add(3);

// Remove element
int removedElement = queue.remove();

// Check if an element exists
boolean exists = queue.contains(2);

// Get the size of the queue
int size = queue.size();
```

## Conclusion

The Queue interface in Java is a crucial part of the Java Collections Framework, providing a way to handle elements in a sequence. Understanding its methods and their usage is essential for effective programming in Java.
